# landing-page

# Project Description
This project was a practice run of setting up a personal web site, or landing page.<br>

This was one of my very first attempts at "real" coding.<br>
The final results are far from what was desired, but it was a worthwhile exercise.<br>
I may return to it, time permitting, but have since created a much better-looking version utilizing Bootstrap.<br>

# Notes
<br>

# Remaining Work
It would benefit from more work, but the later Bootstrap-utilizing assignment will receive priority.<br>
