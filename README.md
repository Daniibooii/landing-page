This was the first HW assignment for my coding bootcamp. The final results are far from what was desired. I was still adjusting to the tiring schedule of a new program, and did not address this assignment until the day before it was due. I have since improved my time management for this course. It would benefit from more work, but the later Bootstrap-utilizing assignment will receive priority.
